            AND COMPUTING </h2>
            <p style="font-size: larger;"> Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded notfor-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and
                Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech
                fields like</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#cloud">Cloud Native Computing</a></li>
                    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
                    <li>Blockchain</li>
                    <li>Internet Of Things</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><strong style="font-size: xx-large;" id="cloud">C</strong>loud Native computing:</h3>
                <p style="font-size: larger;">The <strong> Cloud Native Computing </strong>program prepares the students to program in open source
                    technologies like,<strong>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native </strong>
                    while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
                    techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p>

                    <h3><strong style="font-size: xx-large;">A</strong>rtificial Intelligence</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: larger;">The<strong> artificial intelligence </strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
                        technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like<strong>Python, Numpy, Pandas,
                        Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask </strong>, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
                        ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
                        </p>


                        
                    <h3><strong style="font-size: xx-large;">B</strong>lockchain:</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: larger;">The main emphasis of<strong> Blockchain </strong>program is to understand the blockchains like <strong>Ethereum
                         and Hyperledger (Fabric) </strong>, and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on
                        frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps
                        (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token                  </p>


                        <h3><strong style="font-size: xx-large;">I</strong>nternet of Things:</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: larger;">The <strong> internet of things </strong> program introduces the students to open source development
                            technologies like <strong> Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
                            and Kubernetes </strong> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT
                            Cloud, and voice computing for device control.</p>
